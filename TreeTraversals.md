Two Types of Traversal

## Breadth First Or Level Order Traversal
## Depth First Traversals
  ### In Order 
    * In case of BST gives nodes in increasing order
  ### Pre Order
    * Useful for copying a tree
    * to build prefix expressions

  ### Post Order
    * useful to build postfix expressions
    * useful to delete a tree
